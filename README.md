# Why I made this program ?

In Arch Linux, as with any operating system, increasing cache memory can potentially improve system performance by allowing the system to store frequently accessed data in fast memory that can be quickly accessed. However, there are also potential drawbacks to increasing cache memory.

One potential problem with increasing cache memory is that it can potentially consume a large amount of physical memory, which could lead to increased competition for memory resources and potentially decreased performance if there is not enough available physical memory to meet the system's needs. Additionally, increasing cache memory may not always provide a noticeable improvement in performance, and in some cases it may even lead to decreased performance due to increased memory pressure.
